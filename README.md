# RL Playground

This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with various Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms including TRPO, PPO, DDPG, TD3, and SAC. Different algorithms have been implemented and their performance along with training times have been measured for comparison. The project uses Stable Baselines3.

## Installation

This project uses the `poetry` package manager for dependency management. Make sure you have `poetry` installed. If not, you can install it following the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone repository
   cd RL-Playground

2. Install the dependencies using poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install

## Usage

Each RL algorithm is implemented in separate files (TRPO, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC). Navigate to the specific file to explore the implementation details and configuration options.

To train and evaluate an algorithm, run the respective file. 

## Results

Performance metrics and training times for each algorithm are determined by running the files.
